## Zingbus - YC'21 (2 years 8 months)
* zingbus - an **asset-light** & **SOP-heavy** business. 
* It partners with small and medium size bus fleet operators.
* Aggregates this supply under zingbus brands - plus, maxx, valuebus (kinda like OYO does with hotels)
* Fleet Operator takes complete ownership of - maintenance, staffing, compliance, etc
* zingbus takes care of demand side of the equation
* Gets demand through **OTAs** (redbus, mmt, abhibus), its **[B2C app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zingbusbtoc.zingbus)** (1M+ downloads) & **B2B platform** (focused towards Travel Agents)
* Also completely owns network/schedule planning, training crew, inventory pricing, marketing, CX experience 

On to things I built while I was there ðŸ‘‡


### Apr 2023 - Nov 2024 (Product Manager)

I was leading the whole product pipeline at this point. I had 4 direct reports (1 designer & 3 APMs)

* On Time Guarantee product
* [Supply Portal](https://www.zingbus.com/operator) - Bus Fleet Owner & Admin
    * Payout & Settlement reports
    * Supply Audit reports
    * Crew report cards
    * Onboard & manage supply
    * Occupancy Analytics
    * Customer Feedback & Report card
* Referral Program
    * 
* Multi Modal Product for offbeat destinations
    * Book a cab+bus+cab journey via zingbus. All legs of the journey booked through zingbus & managed via zingbus. E.g. 
        * Shared cab from Gurgaon to Delhi. Wait at zingbus lounge 
        * Bus from Delhi to Aut in a bus
        * Shared cab from Aut to Jibhi
    * zingbus was the first to do this.
* Demand-generation (B2C, B2B)
    * Automated Price Drops (rule based) - On route X to Y, if trip start time is in < 4 hrs & occupancy < 50%, set price to minSupplyPrice
    * Send outbound calls to Travel Agents who work on these routes
    * Send tf rates to Travel Agents who work on these routes  
* Dynamic Pricing Product
    * Get signals (occupancy, prices) from bus ecosystem (OTAs, GDS APIs)

* Curated Marketplace (Partner Buses)
    * We had decent traffic on consumer app & huge Travel Agent network but only 300 buses on the road connecting 500 cities
    * We weren't servicing a lot of the routes the users & travel agents were searching for (resulting in zero result pages)
    * Enter Curated Marketplace - Sell non-zingbus branded supply on our platform
    * Got this inventory via GDS intergations with Bitla, Mantis, Abhibus (These are Amadeus/Sabre equivalents for Bus Travel)
* Valuebus - Demand Aggregation & Dynamic Supply Matching product
* zingprime - Loyalty Pass inclusive of below benefits
    * On-Time Guarantee (if your bus is >45 mins late at your destination or pickup point, 50% refund coupon)
    * Additional 5% discount
    * Free Travel Insurance
    * Better Refund/'Cancellation Policy
    * Was used heavily for Customer Acquisition. Free zingprime on App Install. We'd much rather prefer a customer directly book & repeat through our app rather than from OTA (coz 14% Take Rate)
* Spin The Wheel
    * Reactivation
* Rapido Partnership 
* CRM/User Journeys (through MoEngage & Clevertap)
    * Reactivation Campaigns
