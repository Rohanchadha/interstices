## What Are Network Effects?

Network effects happen when a product, service, or platform's value increases as more people use it.
The concept shapes business strategy and pricing. This is especially true for products and platforms where user numbers influence value.
Examples of network effects appear in e-commerce (Amazon, Flipkart), ridesharing (Rapido, Uber), delivery platforms (Swiggy, zomato, Zepto), and social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn).

## Types of Network Effects

1. **Direct (Same Side network effect):** Platform value grows directly as more users join. Examples include social networks like Reddit, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
2. **Indirect (Cross-Side network effect):** Value increases for one user group as another group grows. For example, more sellers attract more buyers in e-commerce.
