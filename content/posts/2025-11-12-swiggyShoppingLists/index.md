I remember reading an X thread almost a year back about Instamart launching Shopping lists feature in beta.

I hate ordering groceries as much as the next person but I never noticed this feature on Swiggy.
Not until today. So, naturally I tried using it.

Loved it for the most part but it missed some beats for me
* I avg. around 10 Instamart orders a month & I don't use any other quick-commerce platform (coz Swiggy HDFC 10% cashback)
* Most of my orders are repetitive
* Why can't I just save a shopping list in Swiggy, rather have Swiggy create a personalized list for me
* There's order

What metrics would I look at if I was the PM who made this.
