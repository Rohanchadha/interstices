I remember reading an X thread almost a year back about Instamart launching Shopping lists feature in beta.

I hate ordering groceries as much as the next person & I had never noticed this feature on Swiggy. 
Not until today. So, naturally I tried using it.

Some background on how I order:
* I avg. around 25-30 Instamart orders a month (about 15 greater than Rs 500 AOV) & I don't use any other quick-commerce platform (because of the Swiggy HDFC 10% cashback)
* Most (if not all) of my AOV gte Rs 500 orders include repeated SKUs (Yogurt, Paneer, Eggs, veggies, fruits, etc.)
* I also don't switch brands often. I'm not a bargain hunter, I've come to like some brands which Swiggy shows as "Previously Bought" & those are the ones I end up ordering.

So, I'm pretty much a Instamart power user. Shopping Lists could be a super time saving feature for me. But it missed quite a few beats.
1. So, you can create a shopping list by typing, scanning or reading out a list.

2. And I also cannot save a list? Why? Do you always want me type, scan or read out a list?
3. Ideally, the AHA moment could've been if there were pre-created shopping lists for me to choose from based on my order history which there's plenty of.

4. On to the SRP for this shopping list. It's a combined search of all the keywords I entered in the list. Pretty neat UX but none of the SKUs are already added in my Cart. I have to pick and choose the SKUs again and build my cart. Easy opportunity to save the user another ~2 mins

5. I'd have loved if my cart was already built for me to review when the SRP opens & I'd only have to change quantity, switch a brand OR remove an item altogether if my preferred brand is out of stock or I don't like the price of bananas today

If I were to priortize among these 3 t

|Feature|Prirority|Comments|
|---|---|---|
|Saved Shopping List|High|
|Generate personalized shopping lists|Medium|
|Cart building|Medium|

Now I understand if users order more using Shopping lists, they Time To Order also reduces, thus users:
* Spend lesser time viewing ads
* Discover lesser sponsored products
* Discover lesser new product categories from home page, SRP


What metrics would I look at if I was the PM who made this.
