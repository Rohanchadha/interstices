Understanding Poker Player Types: NITs, TAGs, LAGs, and More
  
Three types of good poker players:
* NITS (Really tight players)
* TAGS (Tight Aggressive players)
* LAGS (Loose Aggressive players)

Bad Player Types:
* Loose Passive
* (Loose Passive) Calling Stations
* Bad Aggressive (Maniacs)

1. **The NIT: Scrooges of poker** \
NITs are risk-averse. They only play the very best starting hands pre-flop, rarely getting involved unless they have a good hand. Post-flop, NITs are typically fit-or-fold players, meaning they will continue in the hand only if they hit something strong or have a very good flop.

2. **The TAG: The Tight-Aggressive Player** \
TAGs (Tight-Aggressive) players are also selective with their starting hands, but they play a slightly wider range compared to NITs. Unlike NITs, TAGs are capable of bluffing in well-timed situations. 

3. **The LAG: The Loose-Aggressive Player** \
LAGs (Loose-Aggressive) are risk-takers who play an even wider range of hands than TAGs. They thrive on bluffing and love to put their opponents in tough spots.

4. **The Loose-Passive Player** \
Loose-passive players are characterized by their tendency to limp into pots pre-flop, hoping to see a cheap flop. They are usually risk-averse when faced with pre-flop aggression and will often fold to strong bets.

5. **The Calling Station** \
A calling station is a specific type of loose-passive player, but with one key difference: they hate to fold. Calling stations love to limp and see flops, but they rarely fold to aggression pre-flop.

6. **The Maniac: The Reckless Aggressor** \
Maniacs are the bad player version of LAGs. While skilled LAGs control their aggression, maniacs have no restraint. They bet and raise recklessly, often without regard for the strength of their hand.
