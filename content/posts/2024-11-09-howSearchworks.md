 Google search works in 3 stages. All pages do not necessarily go through all 3 stages.

* Crawling
* Indexing
* Serving Search results

1. Crawling
* Automated Programs called crawlers, download the text, images, and videos of a website
* Google discovers pages through:
    * URL Discovery - Google follows a link from a known page to a new page
    * Sitemaps - you submit a list of pages to Google to crawl

2. Indexing
* Post crawling, google tries to understand what the page is about - by processing and analyzing textual content, key tags of the page
* During this process, google also determines if the page is a duplicate or canonical.
* Canonical is the page that may be shown in the search results. Webpages with similar content are first grouped together & then a page representative of the group is selected as canonical

3. Serving Search Results
* When a user makes a search query, Google Machines searches the index for matching pages
* It returns the result most relevant to the user's query. The relevancy depends on hundred's of factors - location, language, device etc.
